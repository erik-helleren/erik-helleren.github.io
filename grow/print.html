<p>This book is NOT about how to manage software engineering teams.  Its not about how to grow someones career, at least not directly.</p>
<p>This book is about practical techniques to quickly and efficiently develop hard skills and thought patterns in the work place.</p>
<h2 id="consent-and-transparency"><a class="header" href="#consent-and-transparency">Consent and transparency</a></h2>
<p>These techniques are not magic.  They become no less powerful if the student knows what they are or how to apply them.  So don't be afraid to share this resource with them. </p>
<h2 id="feedback"><a class="header" href="#feedback">Feedback</a></h2>
<p>Not only does this let them know you are doing what you are doing, it also opens the door for feedback.  Could you have applied one of these techniques better?  Outside of having a coach present during your working sessions, your students provide the best feedback.</p>
<h2 id="contributions"><a class="header" href="#contributions">Contributions</a></h2>
<p>If you have a technique, tool, or idea you want to see included in this book, open up a PR please.</p>
<h1 id="teaching"><a class="header" href="#teaching">Teaching</a></h1>
<p>This section is focused on the act of teaching.  We define teaching as the act of sharing knowledge with and the development then refinement of though processes in a student.</p>
<p>TODO refine the rest of this content</p>
<p>Also, a lot of the resources I pull may be about &quot;teaching&quot; &quot;students&quot;, this is because there is a lot of theory, data, and practice around formal education.  The best techniques use blended resources (videos, readings, lecture notes), instruction (lecture, modeling), critical thinking (socratic method, reflection exercises), application (practice doing), and formative assessments (Designed to measure where more focus is needed, not so much to assign a grade).  In general, a lot of the stuff discussed in &quot;how to be a better teacher&quot; books, especially those targeted towards STEM teachers, are skills useful for a mentor for JR staff.  Teachers have to efficiently build new skills and behaviors, seeing students typically for 45 min each day, 20-30 at a time.   Books on coaching are often better for mentoring employees as they transition to Sr and beyond.   But both classes of book, in my experience, have ideas useful regardless of career level.</p>
<p>Gentle reminder, here are key transitions that may applicable to jr staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student -&gt; Associate -&gt; SE</li>
<li>Student -&gt; professional life</li>
</ul>
<p>a job elsewhere -&gt; A job at sprout</p>
<p>Part time jobs and internships -&gt; Full Time jobs</p>
<p>One role at sprout -&gt; another role at sprout (i.e. rotation)</p>
<p>Dorm life -&gt; Apartment/ living alone life</p>
<p>High parental involvement -&gt; Lower parental involvement</p>
<p>Short, clearly defined intervals on life (Semester, internship) with clear ending periods and super clear feedback -&gt; Real life where, yes, we get feedback, but there are not clear end dates anywhere in the near future.  There isn't a graduation from a career outside of retirement.</p>

<h1 id="core-concepts"><a class="header" href="#core-concepts">Core concepts</a></h1>
<p>Here are a set of core concepts to keep in mind when helping others grow</p>
<h2 id="students-are-human"><a class="header" href="#students-are-human">Students are human</a></h2>
<p>One of Sprout Social's <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/refreshing-sprouts-values/">core values</a> is to care deeply, so I would be remiss if I did not stress this as the first and arguably most important item in this book: Your student is a human. I know this seems pretty obvious, but it can't be stressed enough.  Humans want to feel valued, appreciated, and like they are making progress towards growth.  They also make mistakes as they grow. Always teach with <em>compassion first</em>.</p>
<p>Properly timed and worded praise communicates your student is on the right path, and helps to increase engagement, keeping you both motivated.  More on positive and negative <a href="teaching/./feedback.html">feedback</a> later.</p>
<h2 id="a-long-marathon"><a class="header" href="#a-long-marathon">A long marathon</a></h2>
<p>A career is a marathon, not a sprint.  One that is measured in decades, not weeks, months, or years. Habits and skills take time and practice to become second nature.  This is especially true for software engineers, where there is a not only a large depth and breadth of understanding expected of senior engineers, but an ability to ask the right questions and conduct research efficiently into unknown concepts.</p>
<p>All this growth takes time.  The important thing is that there is a positive derivative of skill and that positive derivative is proportional to the effort others put into growing the student.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Growth is a process, and a slow one.  Reflect on how long it took to get to where you are today if you ever get frustrated with the pace of progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The growth we see as senior engineers can seem slow to us because we have already ingrained these skills and habits. We see the bug before they have finished the line, or notice the production risk that the unit tests aren't covering on the code review. We have practiced these skills for years and these are skills that get better with practice. They are not learned overnight.  This is especially true for some skills like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying the difference between fact and assumption on the fly</li>
<li>Thinking about problems in the context of a system's architecture</li>
<li>Dealing with production systems etc.</li>
<li>How to refactor code</li>
<li>Thinking about non-functional requirements: Performance, fault tolerance, scalability, security, etc.</li>
<li>Supportability</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, sometimes our students come to us at different levels, which can warp our expectations. There are several factors that could impact how prepared a Jr se is for that first day of their career.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of their internship experiences</li>
<li>Classes that they took (Software testing, software engineering, distributed computing, etc)</li>
<li>Method of the courses taken (Project based, lab based, theory based)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are things which, at the very least, are not fully in the control of the student which impacts their starting point.  So be kind and understanding, and meet them where they are.  Thats the only way for you to have an impact on where they are going.</p>
<h3 id="pacing"><a class="header" href="#pacing">Pacing</a></h3>
<p>Pacing is critical as we are introducing new concepts to our students.  If new concepts come too quickly, they become like a flood and proficiency can't be developed.  If they are too slow, our student could become disengaged.</p>
<p>In general, try to have only a handful of skills at the &quot;fundamental&quot; and &quot;developing -low&quot; levels of proficiency.  Fundamental is defined as exposure to the concept or a rudimentary understanding of the skill.  Developing - low is defined as the first steps in learning a new skill.  The student my have internalized parts of the skill, or learned a few key behaviors, but they still need significant and consistent support to apply the skill.</p>
<p>These two levels of proficiency are where skills are just starting to form, and where you are most likely to have to put on your teaching hat.</p>
<p>&quot;Developing - Medium&quot; is where the student can perform many aspects of the skill, but is inconsistent overall.  This is where we shift from primarily teaching to a blend of coaching and teaching, depending on the context.  How know when to pick which is covered in the coaching chapter.  TODO link</p>
<h2 id="always-be-a-student"><a class="header" href="#always-be-a-student">Always be a student</a></h2>
<p>Being a teacher is defined based on intention and action in the moment.  You are only a teacher when you are teaching.  When in teaching mode, the goal is to impart knowledge and the mindset, often, is that of the expert.  This can inflate egos very quickly.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is always something we can learn from our team members.  We can always benefit from being the student, and can always learn something new.</p>
<p>A key skill for you is the ability to switch off teacher mode to focus on being a student.  The members of your team should be treated as peers, regardless of title, who deserves to have their skills and knowledge respected.  The best way to show respect is to shift quickly and without ego into student mode when they have something to offer.</p>
<p>This has many benefits:  First, your peer will feel valued for their skills.  They get to grow their teaching skills.  You may get to learn something new about software or about your peer.  You may even see new teaching strategies being applied, making you a better teacher.</p>
<p>Please note that this is different from the teachback technique, where the goal is to critique your student as they learn a new concept or skill.  Here, you are a true student.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, we get so swept up with one on one interactions that we forget that documentation plays a key role in helping onboard new team members.</p>
<p>Some key things that you should try to have documented for your team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your SDLC, even if its just a standard model.  Having just a link to an external resource is ok.</li>
<li>Team structure</li>
<li>Production support tooling</li>
<li>Runbooks for common prod issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Its important to keep in mind that for Jr engineers just coming into industry, this may be the first time they see some of these concepts.</p>
<h2 id="silence-is-golden"><a class="header" href="#silence-is-golden">Silence is golden</a></h2>
<p>While silence can be awkward, when it comes to growing the skills of software engineers, its importance cannot be understated.  This is also one of the hardest parts about transiting into a teacher mode from a regular peer mode.  Silence makes humans uncomfortable, as does the look of struggle that creeps over our students faces.</p>
<p>But whats really happening in that silence between the prompt and the answer? The short answer is &quot;ENGINEERING&quot;!  Your student is applying their thought process to the prompt, be it a question, comment, or a prod like &quot;Lets try to refactor this code&quot;.  The precise process varies from person to person and context to context.  For me, I try to start with a type of internal research to form hypothesis's, I then discarding some and refining the rest using the context, and ultimately make a choice.  At least, thats me at my best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its the silence between prompt and response where the student can practice the skills they need to succeed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For tactical advice, get comfortable with awkward silence.  I found that shadowing and performing interviews, if allowed at your company, is a great way to practice.  Candidates will invariably get stuck in that uncomfortable silence where you know the answer by can't say anything.  While the expectation varies based on job level and company, you may eventually prod them to the right answer and feel some relief.  Also, if you are like me and find patience difficult, consider a fidget spinner</p>
<p>Lastly, this silence does not need to be synchronous.  Especially for tricky problems or new problem spaces.  By putting in a thinking break, you set everyone up for success.  You can't provide hints or blurt out the answer, and you aren't stressed by having to sit there.  And its more likely to improve the student's outcome if your student is anxious, struggles under pressure, feels uncomfortable brainstorming out loud, or rushes to judgement.  You should stress that the student is still your priority during this break and explain why you are taking the break.  If you are not clear, this technique can come off as dismissive.</p>
<h2 id="process-over-result"><a class="header" href="#process-over-result">Process over result</a></h2>
<p>Do not focus on the result, but instead the process that lead your student to that result.  Correct code can happen by accident, especially for small scope changes in Jr engineers.</p>
<p>The goal of your teaching should be to instill a rigorous thought process that allow your student to be independent.  They should be able to: ask the right questions, identify their assumptions, answer their own questions thru research, develop their own code, deploy their own software, design systems, and know when to go to the team with ideas, concerns, or opportunities.  Of course, that takes years</p>
<h2 id="you-are-human"><a class="header" href="#you-are-human">You are human</a></h2>
<p>You are human too.  You are going to make mistakes, miss opportunities to help your student learn, provide poorly worded feedback, and provide bad advice.  Be honest with yourself and your student.  If you notice you did something sub-optimal, have a discussion about what happened and how it could have been done better.  Your candor will build trust and respect in while preparing your student to be a better teacher. </p>
<p>First, by discussing <em>what</em> you could have handled it better, you reveal you are not some sage with universal knowledge.  Profession teachers all this <a href="https://tophat.com/glossary/s/sage-on-the-stage/">the sage on the stage</a> model, or the teacher centered model.  It is defined as a 1 way communication model where the teacher knows all, and the students must absorb all.  This is not how engineering works.  By being forthright with your student, they see there is no &quot;one right answer&quot; for how to write code, design software, or architect systems.  This can develop an important skill I call push back, where a Jr engineer will respectfully question the ideas presented by a more Sr engineer or management.  By focusing on what could have been done better, you draw attention to the idea of process over result.  Especially when the end result of your pairing was a merge ready PR, or a resolved production issue.</p>
<p>Second, by discussing <em>how</em> you could have handled the situation better, you improve everyone's ability to teach.  Teaching is a skill, just as engineering is.  And your best teaching teacher is your engineering student.  Sometimes they teach passively, other times, they actively help us grow our teaching skill.  Passive teaching on their part manifests by confusion, misunderstanding, and failing to meet expectations.  This is almost always signal of something.  It could have been the method you used wasn't ideal for the material or their learning style or your technique was just lacking.  It could also have been situational or personal issues that your student was distracted by that impacted the situation.  You will never know if you don't discuss.  Active teaching often presents itself as push back on your suggestions and candid feedback about your teaching style or method.</p>
<p>Give yourself permission to mess up on all things except one: Caring about your student.  Everything else is just part of your learning process as a teacher.  Your openness and candor with your engineering student can only help you both grow.</p>
<h2 id="warp-up"><a class="header" href="#warp-up">Warp up</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter we focused on some common concepts that will be key to your teaching practice.  All of these key skills boil down to two key points.</p>
<p>First, we are humans thus imperfect.  As such imperfect beings, we should focus instead on growth.  This applies both to our students and ourselves.  The adage that &quot;Life is a journey, not a destination&quot; rings true at work as much as it does at home. </p>
<p>Second, </p>
<h1 id="teaching-1"><a class="header" href="#teaching-1">Teaching</a></h1>
<p>Teaching is the art and science of fostering learning new concepts.  Learning is done by your student, and involves understanding and practicing new concepts or skills. Here I use the word &quot;Practice&quot; both in the way that you would have a practice exercise in a text book, and where you have a professional practices where you are iterating and improving on your craft.  The key is improving.</p>
<p>Just because a teacher teaches, doesn't mean that a student learns.</p>
<h2 id="lectures"><a class="header" href="#lectures">Lectures</a></h2>
<p>Lectures are a one directional flow of knowledge from presenter to audience member. When used in isolation, it doesn't support the deep understanding our engineers need.  As such, very few situations call for significant lecturing.  Exceptions typically have several of these traits: </p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult for a student to do self directed research on the subject.
<ul>
<li>There is limited content on the subject.</li>
<li>Significant existing content is misleading or wrong.</li>
<li>Its difficult to know where to start without a lot of context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a large body of knowledge that is required before it can be applied.</li>
<li>The subject is very theoretical</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel the need to lecture, its key that you prepare, preserve your lecture, and present well.  Preparation should consist of documentation describing the content you will be covering in enough depth to convey the subject you are covering.  Those notes don't need to be perfect, but they should be made available before your presentation and updated just after.  Likewise, preserve your lectures as often as possible via a recording.  It should capture your first and foremost.  Your slides should be an afterthought.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&amp;t=6s">present well</a> by knowing how to communicate your ideas.  Consider that video required watching if you want to lecture, noting that you are lecturing and not doing a job talk.</p>
<h2 id="modeling"><a class="header" href="#modeling">Modeling</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://barkleypd.com/blog/instructional-strategy-modeling-why-how-and-why-not/">Modeling</a> is a classic technique used by teachers.  At its core, modeling simply shows the student how to apply the skill with an example done by the teacher.  Sometimes we feel pressured to help our student by making them write every line of code, especially when presented with new situations.  But if they don't, for example, know how to use sockets, its unlikely for them to learn much when you dictate the methods to call and exceptions to catch.</p>
<p>Modeling allows you to be in the drivers seat on a real work item.  Its up to you if you model by using a synthetic example you created, or an on-the-job example.  What is key is that the example is representative, can be generalized, and allows you and the student to demonstrate the skill(s) you want the student to learn.</p>
<p>While modeling, its best to start of with a &quot;I do, we do, you do&quot; process.  For the first example, show the student how to do it. Its important that you thoroughly explain what you are doing and why as you do the task.  Spend time discussing all the dead ends that lead you to your final result, and why those choices were discarded.  Intuition should be noted but explored thoroughly. This is where concepts are introduced, so take your time here.</p>
<p><em>We do</em> is where we start to get into pairing.  You are quick to provide hints, or guiding questions as they work through a different example or on the next part of the original example.  his is the first time the student is applying the concepts, so be gentle but inquisitive.  Do not accept vagueness around the subject you are focusing on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can still have the keyboard if you want, but have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-driver">them navigate while you drive.</a>.  This means you convert their words into code, letting them focus on the new concept while you take care of some of the minutia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly <em>you do</em> is where the student does it themselves.  This pulls together the new concepts and the minutia of writing code that works.  Its important that you practice patience at this point.  It may be appropriate to do this part asynchronously.  Give the student time, and wait till they ask for help before providing it.  Its better to give help in small increments to foster critical thought. Lastly, don't assume they are done until they tell you.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to pull the student into your work to model behaviors.  Pulling them into your refactoring process, or when you are researching a new feature provides a great learning experience.  Make sure to give them a chance to apply these skills though soon after to reinforce the concepts.</p>
<h3 id="pairing"><a class="header" href="#pairing">Pairing</a></h3>
<p>Pairing is distinct from modeling in that the focus is applying more so than leaning.  Not to say that pairing isn't a great way to learn and grow, just that the focus is different.  As the teacher, its you job to know when you should be in <a href="teaching/./pairing.html">pairing mode</a> vs when you should be in modeling mode.</p>
<h2 id="understand-their-thought-process"><a class="header" href="#understand-their-thought-process">Understand their thought process</a></h2>
<p>One of the key parts of developing a quality software engineer is to build a good thought process.  When investigating a though process, I like to envision a mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>.  Each strand of thought branches outward from the problem, building understanding of the problem, the solution space, investigating the solutions, and so on.</p>
<p>While asking for mind maps for larger projects and work items is appropriate, its very high cost.  As such, I recommend conducting frequent and timely mini post mortem interviews.  By asking open ended questions and  is the best way to investigate your students chain of thought.  This is a great tool when applying modeling, pairing, and synchronous code review.  It lets you understand why the end state got to be what it is. </p>
<p>Like all post mortem's, its value is strongly correlated with the quality of the questions being asked.  So before you start the interview, spend a few moments to create a plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on the scope.  It could be on a single method or a PR.  It can be on a design document or something that the student says they are planning on doing.</li>
<li>Would it be best to start at the result or the problem?  The result is typically best for debugging code quality and correctness issues, and the problem is typically the best place to start for design related questions.</li>
<li>Review the problem and result and try to build your own mental mind map.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each node in the map that was correct, fully thought out, and intentionally addressed, provide positive feedback.  For example &quot;Yes, you did think about network and system issues correctly when you implemented this exception handling and retry logic.&quot;  This is especially important to do if you have a map with a bad node or decision in the middle.  Keep going forward after you discuss that bad choice to find the right choices after it.  It can prevent backsliding and self-doubt around the skills that they already have in the bag.  It stresses that to the student that they got a 90% instead of a 50%.</p>
<p>Next, each node that wasn't quite fully flushed out, but was headed in the right direction you get to provide mixed feedback.  This lets the student know they did something right, they just needed to take an extra step or two.</p>
<p>Lastly are nodes that are just bad.  Approach these carefully.  Try to understand what happened here.  Was it just a new concept that was never learned?  Was it sloppiness or forgetfulness?  Did it depend on a skill that was introduced but the student didn't have the time to develop proficiency? Seriously examine the &quot;bad&quot; node before providing feedback.  This might involve delving in a bit more to understand the circumstance.</p>
<p>By focusing on the thought process instead of the final product it is a bit easier to provide high value and actionable feedback.  Stress with your student that Sr engineers are constantly trying to improve their thought processes to be more robust, so there is no shame in needing improvement.  Remember: Your student is human and wants to feel like they are meeting expectations and growing.  It will also take time for them to develop these skills.   Stressing the following whenever using this technique: </p>
<ol>
<li>Your thought process took X years of practice </li>
<li>Your level isn't perfect</li>
<li>You are trying to improve as well</li>
<li>The expectation is to improve over time, not to get to perfect.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Examine the mental mind map one node at a time.  Provide feedback on each node to reinforce good habits and constructive feedback that is hyper targeted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't be shy of using this technique when the result was &quot;correct&quot;.  Worst case, this reinforces the skills they do have, gives them confidence, and gives them an opportunity to practice communication.  Best case, this can reveal subtle bugs in the student's thought process that might cause larger issues later.</p>
<h2 id="asking-good-questions"><a class="header" href="#asking-good-questions">Asking good questions</a></h2>
<p>When trying to build critical thinking skills, like engineering, one of the best tools is a good question.  So why is this?  The answer depends on the type of question being asked, and the situation its being deployed in.</p>
<h3 id="the-open-ended-question"><a class="header" href="#the-open-ended-question">The open ended question</a></h3>
<p>Open ended questions are most easily defined by defining close-ended questions.  A close ended question is a question with a finite set of options and a clear correct answer.  There is little place in software engineering for close ended questions.  That said, this is a continuum where both extremes are rarely called for in the context of teaching.</p>
<p>Here are some open ended questions to try in a teaching context.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What are some potential solutions?&quot; is a great way to start a brainstorming session</li>
<li>&quot;What is the problem we are trying to solve?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Often used to get someone who has been in silent contemplation for a while to discuss where their mind is going</li>
<li>&quot;Are there other options you can think of?&quot; After some options have been discussed.</li>
<li>&quot;What are the tradeoffs of A?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Which way do you want to proceed?&quot; followed by &quot;Why?&quot; to get commitment first followed by the explication.</li>
<li>&quot;Is there a tool that could make this easier?&quot; often asked when refactoring.</li>
<li>&quot;So?&quot;, &quot;And?&quot;, and &quot;Tell me more.&quot; are all gentle prods to keep going</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal with these open ended questions is to exercise the discrete skills underlying software engineering.  Writing correct and serviceable code, understanding requirements, testing, and more.  As skills grow, we expect our students to ask themselves these questions and go about answering them thoroughly and thoughtfully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more open your question, the more developed the students skill must be to answer correctly. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="leading-questions"><a class="header" href="#leading-questions">Leading questions</a></h3>
<p>A leading question in our context is best thought of as a hint disguised as a question.  Leading questions need to be tactfully crafted to deliver just the right amount of direction.  To much, and you risk patronizing your student.  To little and they might not pick up the trail.</p>
<p>A leading question has these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directs to focus on something particular</li>
<li>Open ended enough so the student has to think and communicate a response</li>
<li>Close ended enough so their scope of thought stays focused</li>
</ol>
<p>They can also range from open to closed.  Lets think about a PR which includes this code (Written as psudocode for clarity), lets consider some feedback options.  For both, the focus is on the skill of code readability.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static List&lt;String&gt; extracted(int arg0, DbConnection arg1){
    List&lt;Row&gt; result = arg1.select(&quot;select description,id from parts where barcode == ?&quot;, arg0).execute();
    List&lt;String&gt; out = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    for(int i=0;i&lt;result.size();i++&gt;){
        Row r = result.get(i);
        out.add(r.get(0));
    }
    return out;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Take a few moments and write down 2 or 3 different types of comments you could provide on this code.</p>
<p>First, here is an open example which I would put on line 1.  First I commend the extraction of the method, which is clearly what happened based on the name of the method and the arg names.  Next I and asking for a revision.  Thats it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice job extracting this into a method.  Can you take a second pass on the method itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could make it less open by adding &quot;to improve clarity&quot; reducing the scope of the revision.</p>
<p>Even less open, we could do something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Line 1: Nice job extracting this into a method. </p>
<p>Line 1: Can you think of a better method name and parameter names?</p>
<p>Line 5: Is there a better option than a regular for loop?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see the level of specificity in our questions related to how far the student has developed the skill of writing readable code.    If they are at the foundational level, the latter might be appropriate.  If they are developing, the prior should result in readable code or followup questions.</p>
<h1 id="measurement"><a class="header" href="#measurement">Measurement</a></h1>
<p>One of the most important parts about teaching is confirming that learning has happened.  If it has, you can move onto the next concept or skill, or dive a level deeper into the skill you are working on.  But more importantly, it lets you know when it hasn't.  This data lets you adjust the tools and methods that you use to teach your student.</p>
<p>Measuring progress and understanding is tricky, and its best to use a mix of methods in different contexts.</p>
<h2 id="teach-back"><a class="header" href="#teach-back">Teach-back</a></h2>
<p>Teach back is a technique where the student teaches their understanding of a subject back to the teacher in their own words.  Teach-back is best employed during modeling and pairing.</p>
<p>It's the teachers responsibility to probe the students explanation, trying to find their boundary of knowledge.  Explications that are vague or &quot;hand-wavy&quot; justify follow questions.  Also, using commonly confused terms should be investigated.</p>
<p>Teachback goes beyond just the raw content, to build technical verbal communication skills. If there is an opportunity to make the student's explanation more clear or concise, spend the time to work on it.  Apply other methods to tease out larger concepts or labels that can be applied.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to go heavy handed with this technique.  It can be applied at the smallest scale like when to use an IllegalArgumentException just as effectively the largest when describing the system design of several large services the student may be working on.  The more often the student is engaged in discussions like this, the more comfortable they will become with it.</p>
<p>This also has the benefit of morphing into a skill for the student.  They may start to describe complex problems voluntarily to confirm their own understanding.  They may even start to identify where they are making assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="ab-testing"><a class="header" href="#ab-testing">A/B Testing</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A/B testing.  Come up with 2 solutions to the vague problem, where A is better than B.  Ask the student to consider both options, do any research they need to come to a conclusion, and come back with an argument in favor of A or B.    This can be used to both guide, and evaluate growth.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires double the prework on your part. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puts the student in a position to &quot;pick wrong&quot; from a situation which was open ended with many correct answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shuts the door to C, which is the best option, hands down, that you didn't think of yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pros</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puts up guardrails on vague and very open ended tasks.  Can prevent feeling overwhelmed or being stuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If A OR B was chosen, that provides data around growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasoning behind the choice can give you concrete areas to focus growth on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be successful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both A and B MUST </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meet functional requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On their face, must seem like a reasonable course of action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be materially different from each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B must have clear and explainable reasons why its inferior.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the door open to C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be conscious of how concrete or vague your options are.  Try to leave wiggle room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most room: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new class for the these DB interactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stick the logic in some well defined methods on an existing class </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less room:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create new class CarDbHandler that encapsulates all of the logic to interact with Car DB </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add a method on existing class TruckDbHandler that pulls cars from the car DB.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pause to discuss via a sync BEFORE too much effort is put into coding.  They are free to play around, and try things out in the code and even commit a rough draft.  But we don't want to spend a few days refactoring an inferior solution.</p>
</li>

<p>First is functionality.  This chapter focuses on core fundamentals of writing functional software.  Variables, functions, objects, instances, etc.</p>
<p>Second is code quality.  This chapter focuses on how to turn function software into high quality code.  Topics include refactoring, tooling, testing, etc.</p>
<p>Third is production support.  This chapter is intentionally vague because everyone managed production software a little differently.  It includes writing software for production, log inspection, and more.  </p>
